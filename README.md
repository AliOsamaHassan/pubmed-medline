# PubMed Medline Clustering project

PubMed medline contains approx. 30 million medical journals(~350 GB) which are curated by "NCBI" and is available for
download @ https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/

This project aims to create a clustered repository of PubMed journals; making use of clustering algorithms as well as
powerful distributed computing machinery to process the entire PubMed corpus.

The entire codebase is written in Python-3.6 and is currently under development. The codebase has been tested against
smaller subsets of the PubMed corpus.

Package Dependencies:

    Scikit-learn, Pandas, Scipy, Numpy, NLTK, configparser
